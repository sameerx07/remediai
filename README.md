## Why RemediAI?

Modern applications running on AKS, App Service, or Azure VMs generate exceptions across multiple observability platforms. Engineers spend hours triaging the same recurring patterns. RemediAI provides a scalable agentic framework to automate that investigation — so teams focus on fixing, not finding.

- Reads exception logs from Application Insights / Azure Monitor
- Groups and triages incidents automatically
- Analyzes root cause using LangGraph-based AI agents
- Finds related source code in Azure DevOps Repos
- Recommends fixes with supporting evidence
- Creates Azure DevOps Bugs with full context
- Generates draft Pull Requests after human approval
- Tracks remediation progress in a React dashboard
- Exposes integration health warnings and provider status in the dashboard
- Supports explicit monitoring target selection for local and Kubernetes modes

## Core Workflow

```
1. Exception appears in Application Insights.
2. Log ingestion service queries Azure Monitor using KQL.
3. Incident is written to PostgreSQL with `status='new'`.
4. LangGraph worker polls PostgreSQL and picks up the incident.
5. Triage Agent assigns priority and groups related incidents.
6. Root Cause Agent analyzes the exception and stack trace.
7. Code Context Agent retrieves relevant source files.
8. RAG Agent fetches docs, runbooks, and prior fixes.
9. Fix Planner Agent produces ranked remediation recommendations.
10. Azure DevOps Bug is created with full analysis attached.
11. (Phase 2) PR Agent creates a draft pull request after human approval.
12. Dashboard shows status, metrics, integration warnings, and target policy.
```

## Implementation Phases

Phases 1–21 are complete. Remaining work runs across parallel tracks.

| Track | Phases | Focus |
| ----- | ------ | ----- |
| A — Quality & Security | 15, 17, 18 | PII scrubbing, AI Search index, RAG quality |
| B — PR Workflow | 19, 20, 21 | PR agent, human approval gate, validation |
| C — DevOps & Infrastructure | 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27 | CI/CD, Terraform, AKS, Key Vault, scaling |
| D — Testing & Observability | 16, 23, 28 | E2E tests, OpenTelemetry, load + security testing |

Tracks A, B, C, and D can be staffed in parallel. Phase 28 (load + security
testing) is the final gate that requires all tracks to be complete.

See [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) for the full dependency graph, milestone detail, and release versioning.

## Security Principles

- Human approval required before any code change is merged
- No direct production access for any agent
- Read-only access to logs and source code
- Managed Identity / Workload Identity — no stored credentials
- Azure Key Vault for all secrets
- PII scrubbed from exception payloads before LLM transmission
- Full audit trail for every agent decision
- All PRs validated before human review

See [SECURITY_GUARDRAILS.md](SECURITY_GUARDRAILS.md) for the full security design. To report a vulnerability, see [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).
