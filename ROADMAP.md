# RemediAI — Roadmap

## Current Status

**Active development.** Phases 1–21 are complete and committed. The end-to-end
flow now includes approval-gated draft PR creation and validation
(ingestion → triage → root cause → code context → RAG → fix planner → bug
creation → approval gate → PR agent → validation agent). Work remaining is
organised below into milestones and parallel development tracks.

---

## Milestones

### Milestone 1 — Foundation (Phases 1–2)

**Goal:** Working skeleton that proves the end-to-end flow.

- [x] Repository structure scaffolded
- [x] Domain models defined (Pydantic)
- [x] PostgreSQL schema created and migrated (Alembic)
- [x] Local dev environment with Docker Compose (Postgres, Redis)
- [x] Basic FastAPI app with health check endpoint
- [x] React dashboard shell
- [ ] Full-stack local Docker Compose (all services) → **Phase 20**
- [x] CI pipelines configured (Azure DevOps Pipelines + GitHub Actions) → **Phase 21**

---

### Milestone 2 — Log Ingestion (Phase 3)

**Goal:** Exceptions from Application Insights land in PostgreSQL as incidents.

- [x] Azure Monitor KQL connector implemented
- [x] Exception fingerprinting logic
- [x] Deduplication against existing incidents
- [x] Service Bus publisher
- [x] Incident ingestion service running on schedule

---

### Milestone 3 — Triage + Root Cause (Phases 4–9)

**Goal:** Incidents are analyzed and root cause summaries are produced.

- [x] LangGraph pipeline scaffolded
- [x] Triage Agent: priority assignment, grouping, labeling
- [x] Root Cause Agent: structured root cause summary with agent trace
- [x] Code Context Agent: Azure DevOps Repos code lookup
- [x] RAG Retrieval Agent: Azure AI Search query + result ranking
- [x] Fix Planner Agent: remediation recommendations
- [x] Full agent pipeline runs end-to-end on a sample incident
- [x] Audit log entries written for every agent step

---

### Milestone 4 — Azure DevOps Bug Creation (Phase 11)

**Goal:** Analyzed incidents automatically become Azure DevOps Bugs.

- [x] Azure DevOps Boards REST client

- [x] Integration test with mock ADO client

---

### Milestone 5 — Dashboard (Phases 12 + 14)

**Goal:** Engineers can see and manage incidents in the React UI.

- [x] FastAPI endpoints: incident list, incident detail, metrics
- [x] Pagination, filtering by status / priority / date
- [x] React dashboard: incident list view
- [x] React dashboard: incident detail view with root cause and recommendations
- [x] React dashboard: metrics panel (volume, by status, top errors)
- [x] Work item link visible on incident detail
- [x] End-to-end acceptance test of first milestone flow → Phase 16 ✅

---

### Milestone 6 — Security + Quality Hardening (Phases 15–17)

**Goal:** Production-ready analysis quality and security baseline.

- [x] PII scrubbing before LLM transmission → Phase 15 ✅

---

### Milestone 7 — PR Draft Generation (Phases 18–19)

**Goal:** Approved recommendations can become pull requests — with humans in the loop.

- [x] Human approval gate: dashboard action + approval API endpoint → **Phase 19**
- [x] PR Agent: branch creation from fix recommendation → **Phase 19**
- [x] PR Agent: code patch generation and application → **Phase 19**
- [x] PR Agent: draft PR creation in Azure DevOps → **Phase 19**

- [ ] Key Vault + Workload Identity + KEDA autoscaling → **Phase 24**
- [ ] Azure Monitor alerts for pipeline failures + on-call runbook → **Phase 25**
- [ ] Load and soak testing → **Phase 26**
- [ ] Security review and penetration test → **Phase 26**

---

### Milestone 9 — Extended Language Support (Phases 27–29)

**Goal:** Expand beyond .NET. These are post-v1.0 and out of MVP scope.

- [ ] Python application exception support → **Phase 27**
- [ ] Grafana / Loki log source connector → **Phase 27**
- [ ] Node.js exception support → **Phase 28**
- [ ] Jira work item integration → **Phase 29**

---

## Parallel Development Tracks

Remaining work in Phases 20–26 is split into three independent tracks that can
be staffed in parallel. Phase 26 (Load + Security Testing) is the final merge
gate and runs only after all three tracks are complete.

```
Track A — DevOps & Infrastructure    Track B — Observability
──────────────────────────────────   ─────────────────────────────────
Phase 20: Local Docker Compose           Phase 22: Structured Logging
    ↓                                        + OpenTelemetry
Phase 21: CI Pipeline
    ↓
Phase 23: Terraform + AKS + Helm
    ↓
Phase 24: Key Vault + KEDA
    ↓
Phase 25: Azure Monitor Alerts


Track C — Validation Gate
──────────────────────────────────
Phase 26: Load + Security Testing
```

**All tracks merge at Phase 26 (Load + Security Testing).**

Starting points (with Phases 1–19 complete):
- Track A: start Phase 20
- Track B: start Phase 22
- Track C: start Phase 26 after Tracks A and B

## Remaining Phases — Spec Required Before Implementation

A spec (`docs/specs/phase-NN-*.md`) must exist and be reviewed before any
code is written for that phase.
