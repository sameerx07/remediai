# RemediAI — Claude Code Instructions

## Read Before Writing Code

Always read these files first to understand current state:
`README.md` · `SPEC.md` · `ARCHITECTURE.md` · `AGENT_DESIGN.md` · `TECH_STACK.md` · `SECURITY_GUARDRAILS.md` · `ROADMAP.md`

Phase specs live in `docs/specs/phase-NN-*.md` — read the spec before implementing any phase.

---

## Spec-First Workflow — No Exceptions

**STOP before writing any code.** Follow this sequence every time, without skipping steps:

1. **Identify** the existing spec file in `docs/specs/` that covers the feature or change being requested. Every task maps to an existing phase — find it.
2. **Update that spec** (or create a new one if no existing phase covers it) to reflect what will be built: add new deliverables, update acceptance criteria, note any new dependencies or out-of-scope items.
3. **Update all affected documentation** in the same response: `SPEC.md`, `AGENT_DESIGN.md`, `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `ROADMAP.md`, and any relevant prompt files under `docs/prompts/`.
4. **Then implement.** Spec + docs update and implementation all ship in the same response.

Rules:
- Never create a new spec file for a task that fits an existing phase.
- Never implement before the relevant spec is updated.
- Never implement before affected documentation is updated.
- If a task genuinely spans multiple phases, update all affected specs.
- The spec update is not a summary of what you did — it is written *as if it always belonged there*, in spec voice (imperative, present tense, no past-tense narration).
- If the user asks for code changes without mentioning a spec, **stop and ask**: "Which spec covers this? Should I update an existing one or create a new phase?" Do not proceed until the spec question is resolved.

### Documentation sync checklist (run before every implementation)

For any code change, confirm these are updated in the same response:

| Changed area | Docs to update |
|---|---|
| New agent or agent behaviour | `AGENT_DESIGN.md` · relevant `phase-NN-*.md` |
| New API endpoint | `SPEC.md` (FR section) · `phase-NN-*.md` |
| New domain model field | `SPEC.md` (data model) · `AGENT_DESIGN.md` |
| Language-specific logic | `phase-06-triage-agent.md` · `phase-07-root-cause-agent.md` · affected prompts |
| New integration (SCM, ticketing, ingestion) | `TECH_STACK.md` · `ARCHITECTURE.md` · `SPEC.md` (integration points) |
| New phase | `ROADMAP.md` milestone entry |
| Prompt change | `docs/prompts/` version bump + spec reference updated |

## Commit Rules — No Exceptions

1. **Never** run `git add`, `git commit`, or `git push` without explicit user approval.
   Accepted signals: "commit", "yes", "go ahead", "approve". Silence is not approval.
2. After completing a phase: run `ruff` + `mypy --strict` + `pytest`.
3. For every project code change, validate a local Docker build before phase sign-off:
  - `cp .env.example .env` (if `.env` is missing)
  - `docker compose --env-file .env config`
  - `docker compose --env-file .env build`
4. Show a **Phase Summary**, then **stop and wait**.
5. One commit per phase. No squashing phases without permission.

**Required Phase Summary format:**

```
## Phase N Complete — Awaiting Your Approval
- ruff: ✅  mypy: ✅  tests: ✅ N passed
- [new]      path/to/file.py — what it does
- [modified] path/to/file.py — what changed
Reply "commit" to proceed, or give feedback to adjust first.
```

5. Triage agent  
6. Root cause agent  
7. Code context agent  
8. RAG retrieval agent  
9. Fix planner agent  
10. Azure DevOps Bug integration  
11. FastAPI dashboard endpoints  
12. React dashboard

## Language-Agnostic Development Rules

RemediAI supports multiple languages. Every code change must be evaluated against this checklist:

**Before implementing anything that touches exception handling, stack traces, triage rules, or file extensions:**

1. **Is this change language-specific?** If yes — stop. Check whether it belongs in a language module (e.g., `_RULES_BY_LANGUAGE["dotnet"]`) rather than the shared pipeline.
2. **Does this hardcode a file extension** (`.cs`, `.py`, `.js`, `.java`)? If yes — make it configurable or language-dispatched.
3. **Does this hardcode framework internal prefixes** (`System.`, `Microsoft.`, `site-packages/`)? If yes — add it to `language_internals.py` under the correct language key, not inline.
4. **Does this assume a stack trace format**? If yes — check that the parser handles all supported formats or explicitly documents which format it handles.

**Language support tiers (do not skip steps):**

| Tier | Languages | Status |
|------|-----------|--------|
| MVP | .NET | ✅ Complete |
| Foundation | Language-agnostic engine | Phase 36 |
| v1.x | Python | Phase 27 |
| v1.x | Node.js | Phase 28 |
| Future | Java | Unscheduled |

Adding Python or Node.js support without Phase 36 complete will create merge conflicts and regressions. **Do not implement Phase 27 or 28 until Phase 36 is committed.**

## Safety Rules

- No secrets in code — use `pydantic-settings` + environment variables.
- Mask PII (emails, IPs, user IDs) before any LLM call.
- All agent decisions must be written to the `audit_log` table.
- No unauthenticated HTTP calls or shell execution inside agent tools.
- Never auto-merge PRs or modify production directly.
- **Any new agent that calls an LLM must call `scrub()` from `packages.integrations.pii_scrubber` on `exception_message` and `stack_trace` before `json.dumps`. Any phase that modifies an existing agent's `_call_llm()` must preserve these calls. See `docs/specs/phase-15-pii-scrubbing.md`.**

---

## Coding Standards

- Type hints on all function signatures.
- Pydantic v2 models for all data structures.
- SQLAlchemy 2.0 async ORM — no raw SQL except migrations.
- `ruff` (lint + format) and `mypy --strict` must pass before finishing any phase.
- `structlog` with `correlation_id` and `incident_id` bound to every log record.
- Unit tests for business logic; integration tests with mock clients for Azure connectors.

---

## Spec-Driven Development Rules

- Write specs **1–2 phases ahead**, not all at once. Specs written too early will be wrong.
- A spec must answer: Goal · Deliverables · Security touchpoints · Acceptance criteria · Out of scope. Nothing else is required.
- **Security touchpoints** — every spec author must answer these before writing implementation details:
  - Does this phase make an LLM call? → `scrub()` is required on all user-text fields.
  - Does this phase write agent decisions? → `AgentTraceEntry` in `state["agent_trace"]` is required.
  - Does this phase introduce a new credential? → Note it must come from `pydantic-settings`; Key Vault in production.
  - Does this phase expose a new HTTP endpoint? → State the authentication requirement, even if deferred.
  - Does this phase add or change language-specific logic? → Note the language scope and which other language tiers are affected.
- Cross-cutting concerns (PII scrubbing, structlog, audit log) are **foundations**, not hardening. They belong in the earliest phase that introduces the pattern — not in a later cleanup phase.
- When a phase modifies an existing agent's `_call_llm()`, explicitly confirm the existing `scrub()` calls are preserved.
- When a phase adds language-specific logic, explicitly confirm it is isolated to a language module and does not affect other languages.

## What's Next

After every task, end with a **"What's Next"** block: 2–3 numbered options (1, 2, 3), exactly one marked `✅ Recommended`, tied to `ROADMAP.md` progress. Never ask the user what to do — present numbered options and let them reply with a number. Example format:

```
**What's Next?**
1. ✅ Recommended — <description>
2. <description>
3. <description>
Reply with 1, 2, or 3.
```

## Documentation Sync

Any code change must update relevant docs in the **same response**. Full doc-sync table is in `CONTRIBUTING.md`.
