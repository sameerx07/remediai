RemediAI is an AI-powered exception analysis and remediation platform for enterprise .NET applications on Azure.

It detects application exceptions from Azure Monitor / Application Insights, analyzes root cause using AI agents, creates remediation recommendations, and generates Azure DevOps work items and pull requests for human review.

---

## Why RemediAI?

Modern applications running on AKS, App Service, or Azure VMs generate exceptions across multiple observability platforms. Engineers spend hours triaging the same recurring patterns. RemediAI provides a scalable agentic framework to automate that investigation — so teams focus on fixing, not finding.

- Reads exception logs from Application Insights / Azure Monitor
- Groups and triages incidents automatically
- Analyzes root cause using LangGraph-based AI agents
- Finds related source code in Azure DevOps Repos
- Recommends fixes with supporting evidence
- Creates Azure DevOps Bugs with full context
- Generates draft Pull Requests after human approval
- Tracks remediation progress in a React dashboard

## Core Workflow

```
1. Exception appears in Application Insights.
2. Log ingestion service queries Azure Monitor using KQL.
3. Incident event is published to Azure Service Bus.
4. LangGraph worker picks up the incident.
5. Triage Agent assigns priority and groups related incidents.
6. Root Cause Agent analyzes the exception and stack trace.
7. Code Context Agent retrieves relevant source files.
8. RAG Agent fetches docs, runbooks, and prior fixes.
9. Fix Planner Agent produces ranked remediation recommendations.
10. Azure DevOps Bug is created with full analysis attached.
11. (Phase 2) PR Agent creates a draft pull request after human approval.
12. Dashboard shows status, metrics, and remediation progress.
```

## Security Principles

- Human approval required before any code change is merged
- No direct production access for any agent
- Read-only access to logs and source code
- Managed Identity / Workload Identity — no stored credentials
- Azure Key Vault for all secrets
- PII scrubbed from exception payloads before LLM transmission
- Full audit trail for every agent decision
- All PRs validated before human review

See [SECURITY_GUARDRAILS.md](SECURITY_GUARDRAILS.md) for the full security design. To report a vulnerability, see [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).
