  "dependencies": {
    "react": "^18.3",
    "react-dom": "^18.3",
    "react-router-dom": "^6.24",
    "@tanstack/react-query": "^5.48",

  }
}
```

## Local Development

Local development uses Docker Compose to run the same dependency shape used in AKS:

```yaml
services:
  postgres:
    image: postgres:16
    environment:
      POSTGRES_DB: remediai
      POSTGRES_USER: remediai
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: ${POSTGRES_PASSWORD:-change_me_locally}

  redis:
    image: redis:7-alpine
```

Azure services (OpenAI, AI Search, DevOps, Monitor) are accessed via real Azure credentials in dev. Use a dedicated non-production Azure subscription.

## Version Pinning Policy

- Pin major and minor versions for all production dependencies.
- Pin major only for dev/test tooling.
- Run `pip-audit` and `npm audit` in CI to catch known vulnerabilities.
- Dependabot enabled for automated patch-level updates with PR review.
