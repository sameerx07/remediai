# RemediAI — Claude Code Instructions

## Read Before Writing Code

Always read these files first to understand current state:
`README.md` · `SPEC.md` · `ARCHITECTURE.md` · `AGENT_DESIGN.md` · `TECH_STACK.md` · `SECURITY_GUARDRAILS.md` · `ROADMAP.md`

Phase specs live in `docs/specs/phase-NN-*.md` — read the spec before implementing any phase.

## Spec-First Workflow — No Exceptions

Before writing any implementation code:

1. **Identify** the existing spec file in `docs/specs/` that covers the feature or change being requested. Every task maps to an existing phase — find it.
2. **Update that spec** to reflect what will be built: add new deliverables, update acceptance criteria, note any new dependencies or out-of-scope items.
3. **Then implement.** Spec update and implementation ship in the same response.

Rules:
- Never create a new spec file for a task that fits an existing phase.
- Never implement before the relevant spec is updated.
- If a task genuinely spans multiple phases, update all affected specs.
- The spec update is not a summary of what you did — it is written *as if it always belonged there*, in spec voice (imperative, present tense, no past-tense narration).

---

## Commit Rules — No Exceptions

1. **Never** run `git add`, `git commit`, or `git push` without explicit user approval.
   Accepted signals: "commit", "yes", "go ahead", "approve". Silence is not approval.
2. After completing a phase: run `ruff` + `mypy --strict` + `pytest`.
3. For every project code change, validate a local Docker build before phase sign-off:
  - `cp .env.example .env` (if `.env` is missing)
  - `docker compose -f docker-compose.local.yml --env-file .env config`
  - `docker compose -f docker-compose.local.yml --env-file .env build`
4. Show a **Phase Summary**, then **stop and wait**.
5. One commit per phase. No squashing phases without permission.

**Required Phase Summary format:**

```
## Phase N Complete — Awaiting Your Approval
- ruff: ✅  mypy: ✅  tests: ✅ N passed
- [new]      path/to/file.py — what it does
- [modified] path/to/file.py — what changed
Reply "commit" to proceed, or give feedback to adjust first.
```

## MVP Build Order

1. Project structure + domain models  
2. PostgreSQL schema + Alembic migrations  
3. Azure Monitor KQL connector  
4. Ingestion service + Service Bus publisher  
5. Triage agent  
6. Root cause agent  
7. Code context agent  
8. RAG retrieval agent  
9. Fix planner agent  
10. Azure DevOps Bug integration  
11. FastAPI dashboard endpoints  
12. React dashboard

## Safety Rules

- No secrets in code — use `pydantic-settings` + environment variables.
- Mask PII (emails, IPs, user IDs) before any LLM call.
- All agent decisions must be written to the `audit_log` table.
- No unauthenticated HTTP calls or shell execution inside agent tools.
- Never auto-merge PRs or modify production directly.
- **Any new agent that calls an LLM must call `scrub()` from `packages.integrations.pii_scrubber` on `exception_message` and `stack_trace` before `json.dumps`. Any phase that modifies an existing agent's `_call_llm()` must preserve these calls. See `docs/specs/phase-15-pii-scrubbing.md`.**

---

## Coding Standards

- Type hints on all function signatures.
- Pydantic v2 models for all data structures.
- SQLAlchemy 2.0 async ORM — no raw SQL except migrations.
- `ruff` (lint + format) and `mypy --strict` must pass before finishing any phase.
- `structlog` with `correlation_id` and `incident_id` bound to every log record.
- Unit tests for business logic; integration tests with mock clients for Azure connectors.

---

## Spec-Driven Development Rules

- Write specs **1–2 phases ahead**, not all at once. Specs written too early will be wrong.
- A spec must answer: Goal · Deliverables · Security touchpoints · Acceptance criteria · Out of scope. Nothing else is required.
- **Security touchpoints** — every spec author must answer these before writing implementation details:
  - Does this phase make an LLM call? → `scrub()` is required on all user-text fields.
  - Does this phase write agent decisions? → `AgentTraceEntry` in `state["agent_trace"]` is required.
  - Does this phase introduce a new credential? → Note it must come from `pydantic-settings`; Key Vault in production.
  - Does this phase expose a new HTTP endpoint? → State the authentication requirement, even if deferred.
- Cross-cutting concerns (PII scrubbing, structlog, audit log) are **foundations**, not hardening. They belong in the earliest phase that introduces the pattern — not in a later cleanup phase.
- When a phase modifies an existing agent's `_call_llm()`, explicitly confirm the existing `scrub()` calls are preserved.

## What's Next

After every task, end with a **"What's Next"** block: 2–3 options, exactly one marked `✅ Recommended`, tied to `ROADMAP.md` progress. Never ask the user what to do — present options and let them choose.

## Documentation Sync

Any code change must update relevant docs in the **same response**. Full doc-sync table is in `CONTRIBUTING.md`.
