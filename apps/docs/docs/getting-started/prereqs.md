# Prerequisites

Before setting up RemediAI you need the following accounts, tools, and Azure resources.

---

## Required tools

| Tool | Minimum version | Notes |
|------|----------------|-------|
| Python | 3.12+ | `python --version` to check |
| Node.js | 20 LTS | For the React dashboard |
| Docker Desktop | Latest stable | For local dependencies |
| Azure CLI (`az`) | 2.60+ | `az version` to check |
| Git | 2.40+ | |
| Poetry | 1.8+ | `pip install poetry` |

---

## Azure resources

You need a **non-production** Azure subscription with the following resources provisioned (or the ability to create them):

| Resource | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| Azure Application Insights | Log source — where your .NET app writes exceptions |
| Azure Monitor Workspace | KQL query target |
| Azure Service Bus (Standard or Premium) | Incident event queue (`incident-events` topic) |
| Azure OpenAI | GPT-4o model deployment for agent reasoning |
| Azure AI Search (Basic tier or above) | RAG index for runbooks, docs, and prior fixes |
| Azure DevOps organisation | Repos for code context; Boards for Bug creation |
| Azure Key Vault | Secret storage for all credentials |
| PostgreSQL (Azure Flexible Server, or local Docker) | Incident and audit persistence |
| Redis (Azure Cache, or local Docker) | API response caching |

:::tip Local development
For local development, PostgreSQL and Redis run in Docker. You still need real Azure credentials for Application Insights, OpenAI, AI Search, DevOps, and Key Vault — use a dedicated **non-production** subscription.

## Azure permissions

The identity you use to set up RemediAI must be able to:

- Create and assign Managed Identities
- Create role assignments on Application Insights, Service Bus, OpenAI, AI Search, Storage, and Key Vault
- Create Personal Access Tokens in Azure DevOps (or manage service connections)

---

## Azure DevOps setup

1. Create or identify an Azure DevOps organisation and project.
2. Create a **Personal Access Token (PAT)** with the following scopes:
   - `Work Items: Read & Write` (for Bug creation)
   - `Code: Read` (for code context)
   - `Code: Read & Write` (for PR Agent — Phase 2 only)
3. Store the PAT in Azure Key Vault (never in environment files committed to source control).

---

## .NET application requirements

RemediAI reads exceptions from Azure Monitor. Your .NET application must:

- Send telemetry to Application Insights (via the Application Insights SDK or OpenTelemetry with Azure Monitor exporter).
- Log unhandled exceptions with a full stack trace.
- Use the `exceptions` table in Application Insights (standard SDK behaviour).

## Next step

Once all prerequisites are met, proceed to [Installation](./installation).
