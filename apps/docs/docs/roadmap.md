# Roadmap

RemediAI follows a phase-based build plan. Phases 1–21 are complete. The remaining work runs across parallel tracks targeting v1.0 production readiness.

---

## Current status

**Active development — v0.4.** Phases 1–21 are complete and committed. The end-to-end flow includes:

- Exception ingestion → triage → root cause → code context → RAG → fix planner → bug creation
- Human approval gate → PR agent → validation agent
- React dashboard with incident list, detail view, and approval workflow
- Full PII scrubbing, audit log, and CI/CD pipeline

---

## Milestones

### Milestone 1 — Foundation ✅

Working skeleton with domain models, PostgreSQL schema, and FastAPI shell.

### Milestone 2 — Log Ingestion ✅

Azure Monitor KQL connector, fingerprinting, deduplication, Service Bus publisher.

### Milestone 3 — Triage + Root Cause ✅

Full LangGraph pipeline: Triage → Root Cause → Code Context → RAG → Fix Planner → Bug Creation.

### Milestone 4 — Azure DevOps Bug Creation ✅

ADO Boards REST client, Bug creation, work item linked to incident.

### Milestone 5 — Dashboard ✅

FastAPI endpoints, React incident list, detail view, metrics panel.

### Milestone 6 — Security + Quality Hardening ✅

PII scrubbing, RAG index population, prompt versioning, agent eval harness.

### Milestone 7 — PR Draft Generation ✅

Human approval gate, PR Agent, Validation Agent, draft PR workflow.

Phase 21: CI Pipeline ✅                     + OpenTelemetry
Phase 23: Terraform + AKS + Helm
Phase 24: Key Vault + KEDA
Phase 25: Azure Monitor Alerts

Track C — Validation Gate
──────────────────────────────────
Phase 26: Load + Security Testing
         (requires Tracks A + B complete)
```

## What "complete" looks like at v1.0

At the end of Phase 26, RemediAI will be:

- Fully deployed on AKS with Helm charts
- Provisioned via Terraform
- Using Key Vault + Workload Identity — zero stored credentials
- Horizontally scalable via KEDA and HPA
- Observable via OpenTelemetry + Azure Monitor + Grafana
- Validated under load and security-reviewed

No additional phases will be added before v1.0 unless product requirements change.
